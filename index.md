title:  Michael Malick | About

I'm a quantitative ecologist at [NOAA fisheries][NMFS] based at the [Manchester
Research Station][MANCH] in Manchester, WA. I synthesize complex ecological
and fisheries data sets to improve conservation of marine and anadromous
species.

My research is broadly guided by the idea that careful applications of
statistical and simulation models can improve our ability to develop
conservation and management strategies that are robust to climate change and
ecological surprises.

<!--
In my current position, I am part of a team studying the impacts and
effectiveness of Pacific salmon conservation programs in the Pacific Northwest.
Our research spans freshwater and marine environments includes a mix of
manipulative experiments and synthesis analysis.

My areas of active research include:

- Impacts of ecosystem change on the spatiotemporal dynamics of fish demographics,
  e.g., [temperature][HTEMP], [ocean currents][CURRENTS], [phytoplankton dynamics][PHYTO]
- Nonstationary dynamics of fish populations and climate effects, e.g., [time
  varying productivity][TRENDS], [nonstationary climate effects][NONSTAT]
- Untangling the [pathways linking climate processes and fish dynamics][BNET]
- Ecosystem based management strategies for transboundary species, e.g.,
  [Pacific salmon][EBFM] and Pacific hake


As an [NRC postdoctoral research fellow][NRC], I was part of a [diverse team of
scientists][JSCOPE2] studying spatiotemporal dynamics of Pacific hake along the
west coast of North America. As part of this project, I lead research to develop
6-month ahead forecasts of Pacific hake spatial distribution using seasonal
projections of ocean conditions from the [J-SCOPE model][JSCOPE1].

My Ph.D. thesis at Simon Fraser University examined environmental forcing
pathways linking climatic and ocean processes to dynamics of Pacific salmon
populations in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. In this work, I used a range of
quantitative modeling techniques (e.g., Bayesian hierarchical models,
probabilistic networks, and state-space models) to identify spatially coherent
effects of environmental forcing on productivity of salmon populations
throughout North America. In my M.Sc. thesis at the University of Alaska
Fairbanks, I examined how environmental forcing impacts the spatial and temporal
dynamics of coho salmon populations throughout Southeast Alaska.
