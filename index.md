title:  Michael Malick | About
---

I'm a quantitative ecologist at [NOAA fisheries][NMFS] based at the [Manchester
Research Station][MANCH] in Manchester, WA. I synthesize complex ecological
and fisheries data sets to improve conservation of marine and anadromous
species.

My research is broadly guided by the idea that careful applications of
statistical and simulation models can improve our ability to develop
conservation and management strategies that are robust to climate change and
ecological surprises.

<!--
In my current position, I lead a team studying the resilience of Pacific salmon
to rapid environmental change. Our research spans freshwater and marine
environments and includes a mix of manipulative experiments and quantitative
synthesis analysis.

My areas of research include:

- Impacts of ecosystem change on the spatiotemporal dynamics of fish demographics,
  e.g., [fecundity][FECUND], [temperature][HTEMP], [ocean currents][CURRENTS],
  [phytoplankton dynamics][PHYTO]
- Nonstationary dynamics of fish populations and climate effects, e.g., [time
  varying productivity][TRENDS], [nonstationary climate effects][NONSTAT]
- [Forecasting population dynamics][FCAST] under changing environments
- Untangling the [pathways linking climate processes and fish dynamics][BNET]
- Ecosystem based management strategies for transboundary species, e.g.,
  [Pacific salmon][EBFM] and Pacific hake

As an [NRC postdoctoral research fellow][NRC], I was part of a [diverse team of
scientists][JSCOPE2] studying spatiotemporal dynamics of Pacific hake along the
west coast of North America. As part of this project, I lead research to develop
6-month ahead forecasts of Pacific hake spatial distribution using seasonal
projections of ocean conditions from the [J-SCOPE model][JSCOPE1].

My Ph.D. thesis at Simon Fraser University focused on improving predictions of
climate impacts on North American Pacific salmon. In this work, I used a range
of quantitative methods (e.g., Bayesian hierarchical models, probabilistic
networks, and state-space models) to identify spatially coherent ecosystem
drivers of salmon abundance and productivity throughout North America. In my
M.Sc. thesis at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, I examined how environmental
forcing impacts the spatial and temporal dynamics of coho salmon populations
throughout Southeast Alaska.
